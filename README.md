# Permissions Tool for sysPass

Manage permissions for [sysPass](https://github.com/nuxsmin/sysPass) accounts.

## Features

1. Set permissions for accounts
2. Get accounts without permissions

## Why?

1. sysPass allows to import data from csv / xml files or [API]((https://syspass-doc.readthedocs.io/en/3.1/application/api.html)), 
but it doesn't support permissions.

2. At the moment (14.12.2022) I didn't find suitable solution.`
